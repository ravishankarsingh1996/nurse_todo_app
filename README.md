# Nurse Todos App

- Instructions:

Run you app directly on device


- What you were trying to implement but it did not work
I was trying to implement the logic to show the current shift todos only to the nurse but it
didn't went well and needed more time to configure.


- What you would implement if you had more time (be specific here)
1. Right now the pending task will be automatically added to next shift if they are in complete but
I was planning to add an option for the Nurses to let them know they have some pending task and
that needs to be transferred to next shift.

- Additional things
I have added a filter option at the top to filter the todos with the patient name.
Todos can be created for any specific patients (It will make easier to filter out the todos they need to work in their shift)
